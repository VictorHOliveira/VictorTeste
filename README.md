# INTRODUCTION #
This project is a test for a interview.

# ABOUT ME #
I'm Victor Oliveira, 35y, I'm from Brazil, but for now I live with my family in Portugal. I'm QA almost 10 years, which the inicial 4 years I worked wich manual testing at HSBC, before this I wokrking at SASCAR with manual andautomation system and hardware testing, with equipament of tracking of truck and load, only projects where I use C# and a little of JAVA. 

After this I worked at Paraná Bank, with consignted credit system, in the beginning I use C#, but before mounths I talk to my coordenator and moving to Robotframework, Me and my pair QA just learn Robotframework and implement in a two weeks, we implement tests web using SeleniumLibrary, API tests using RequestsLibrary and run in a Azure Pipeline. Still at Paraná Bank I started 7 news squads, doing a traning of PO, Scrum Master and Dev Team in a Agile/Kanban, Gherkin, Quality Assurence vision, started too the automation projects with Robotframework and pass the knowledge for anothers QA to assume the squad and the project.

After this time I moving to Toro Investiments, an company that work with stock exchange(financial investiment), where I stated too the new project with Robotframework and taning the QA team wich 2 people, but there it was a Mobile Project, the only challenge was to integrate the Robotframework with Flutter, I had to convince the dev team to update Flutter to a higher than 2.0 version, to accept Appium's commands and so it was done!

And my last experience was as Specialist Automation with a team of 4 Seniors, but in this case it was more about support for the team, help with Base Project Mobile and Web, integrations with Jira, Zephyr, Azure, Grafana, Data Base, Browser Stack, Perfecto and send e-mail with Robotframework's final report. I traning too the client analysts with Robotframework and good practices of quality assurence.

At this moment I moving with my family to Portugal, to working at Aubay, abig change in our lifes, but this is going great!
